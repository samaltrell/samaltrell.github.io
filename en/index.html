<p>
Lair is a board game club at the Faculty of Engineering LTH.
The club is open to everyone; you do not have to be a student to play
at our gaming events.

<p>
We have regular meetups every Thursday, starting at 18.00 in E-huset's basement.
We meet at the study rooms in the south corridor next to E:Falk.
(<a href="map.html">See the map</a>.)

<p>
Lair has a board game <a

in our cabinets in the basement, but everyone is welcome to bring their
own games to the club.

<p>
<i>You need a student ID card to get intothe building, since the doors lock at 17.00.
If you want to be let in, write in the discord and we will open for you.
